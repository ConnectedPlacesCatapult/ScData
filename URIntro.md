##Building your Sharing Cities Dashboard

Hello and thank you for taking the time to support development of the Sharing Cities Dashbaord in your city! If you are not familiar with the Sharing Cities project taking place in your city, we have provied some more information below at __Step #1__. If you are familiar with the project and want to get started, please skip to __Step #2__. 

###Step 1 - Introduction

The Sharing Cities project seeks to create a better, common approach to making smart cities a reality. By fostering international collaboration between industry and cities, the project seeks to develop affordable, integrated, commercial-scale smart city solutions with a high market potential. 

Sharing Cities wants to build a framework for citizen engagement and collaboration at local level, thereby strengthening trust between cities and citizens. The project draws on €24 million in EU funding. It aims to trigger €500 million in investment and to engage over 100 cities  across Europe.

Achieving these goals, involves a number of different work packages (WP) each focusing on the challenge from different perspective. Some of these perspectives are focused on citizen engagement, others are focused on the deployment of technology. For this research, our specific task is to inform the the creation of a dashboard that enables citizens and technical city decisionmakers to act on the knowledge that is created by newly deployed technologies. These technologies often relate to internet of things (IoT) solutions to challenges relating to housing retrofit, integrated energy management and shared eMobility but may also incorporate data from other areas such as existing city data stores.

###Step 2 - Why we need you

As a technical decisionmaker or key part of the city's services, we need your feedback so that we can create a dashboard that is as useful as possible. In our dashboard, we will be combining data made available by your city's services with data from exisitng datastores and want to know what information you are keen to have easy access to.
