# Working examples for the Sharing Cities Dashboard
---


##### I work in the air quality department for the city. I want to use the air quality data from the lamppost sensors to:

1. Create a 'heatmap' of temperature so that I can see how temperature varies throughout the city at this moment in time. 
2. Create a time series plot of the average hourly temperature for sensor ABC and sensor DEF. I want to compare the two locations on the same plot. 
3. See if the mean daily temperature for all sensors correlates with the number of bikes removed from docking stations at all sensors in the city. 
4. Create an alert that makes it visually clear if any of the sensors in the city record a Carbon Monoxide value greater than 50ppm. 
5. Get an estimate for the air quality tomorrow based on the last week's readings. 

##### I'm a mobility expert and i'm interested in how electric vehicles are being charged in our city. I'd like to investigate:

1. Where are there EV chargers in the city? I want to see each of the individual charging points on a map and if possible, I want information about each one.
2. I want to know Which EV chargers are used most frequently. Ideally, I could colour the points on the map with the daily mean number of charge events over the last month. 
3. I want to know what time of day the chargers at point ABC are used most often. I want to see a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) of when charging events occur.
4. Though this may be __private__ because im a technical user, who has logged in, i'd like to see the real-time location of the Electric Vehicles involved in the Sharing Cities scheme. 

##### I'm a citizen 

1. I own an EV and I'd like to check the public dashboard to see what EV chargers are currently available. If none are available i'd like to see which are estimated to be available next based on the State of Charge of current vehicles. 

2. Because i'm interested in new technologies i'd like to get the same information for the Electric bikes that are now available in my city. 

3. I'm just about to go into the city to see a friend. I want to park somewhere and need to know which parking spots are currently available. If I can't find out, i'd like to see a prediction of when things are normally busiest so that we can go when more parking spaces are likely to be available.

##### I'm a building manager and I'm concerned with how much energy my building is using. 

1. I'd like to know if our building is using more electricity than it's solar panels are producing. 
2. I'd like to know if the public lighting electricity consumption is greater than the energy generation of my building over the last week.
