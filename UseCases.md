# Working examples for the Sharing Cities Dashboard
---


##### I work in the air quality department for the city. I want to use the air quality data from the lamppost sensors to:

1. Create a 'heatmap' of temperature so that I can see how temperature varies throughout the city at this moment in time. 
2. Create a time series plot of the average hourly temperature for sensor ABC and sensor DEF. I want to compare the two locations on the same plot. 
3. See if the mean daily temperature for all sensors correlates with the number of bikes removed from docking stations at all sensors in the city. 
4. Create an alert that makes it visually clear if any of the sensors in the city record a Carbon Monoxide value greater than 50ppm. 

##### I'm a mobility expert and i'm interested in how electric vehicles are being charged in our city. I'd like to investigate:

1. Where are there EV chargers in the city? I want to see each of the individual charging points on a map and if possible, I want information about each one.
2. I want to know Which EV chargers are used most frequently. Ideally, I could colour the points on the map with the mean number of charge events on a daily basis. 
3. I want to know what time of day the chargers at point ABC are used most often. I want to see a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) of when charging events occur.
4. Though this may be __private__ i'd like to see the real-time location of the Electric Vehicles involved in the Sharing Cities scheme.
